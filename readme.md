# Project Blinky LED with FreeRTOS and QPC

A simple blinky project, trying maximize the use of the sysconfig tool, using FreeRTOS provided by C2000Ware 05.00.00.00 and QPC from QuantumLeaps.

In this project each Core blinky it's own LED.

## Getting Started

## Tools:

- QM: 6.1.1
- QPC framework: 7.3.3
- SDK: C2000WARE 05.02.00.00
- SYSCONFIG: V1.19.0

### Importing

To import this project import the System Project, on root. and remember to check the "Import referenced projects in the same search-directory" box.

### Running

To debug all projects run with the System Project selected.

### Command File

The Command file is generated by sysconfig.
While swiching between RAM and Flash, it's necessary
set or delete the _FLASH symbol on Prject's proprieties.


## Making another build configuration:

- Copy the Debug Build Configuration
- Change the "Debug" from the "Predefined Symbols" to your new Build Configuration Name

- Change the pre-build step of the CM replacing Debug to your new Build Configuration Name

### Notes

- Stack Usage:

When using a RTOS, it's recommended to use the "Stack Usage View" to make sure that all functions called will fit on the space reserved in each Task or Active Object, remember consider to use short sized stack on ISRs because any ISR use the current task's stack, then every task will have stack with a empty space to support any ISR, if you are nesting ISRs you have to be more carefull about this space.
